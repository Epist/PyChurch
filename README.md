# PyChurch

This repository will hold a growing library of tools for using Python and Church together in order to combine both programs' strong points.
The goal is to use Church for numerical probabilistic modeling using a sampling semantics and Python for subsequent data analysis and visualization. This compliments the Church command line tools at https://github.com/probmods/webchurch
