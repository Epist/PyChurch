# PyChurch

This repository will hold a growing library of tools for using Python and Church together in order to combine both languages' strong points.
The goal is to use Church for numerical probabilistic modeling and Python for subsequent data analysis and visualization. This compliments the Church command line tools at https://github.com/probmods/webchurch
